--A small recount of findings encountered during our last session--

Goal:

Starting with a working python script (load_raw.py), make that tool available through Galaxy (as a custom tool).

Procedure:

1) The python script requires an input file, sends no output to stdout, and works fine.
   load_raw.py --citations [Input_file]

2) So I reviewed the tutorial for adding custom tools to Galaxy, which is available at: https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Tools/AddToolTutorial, so I had to create a new folder, and an .xml

3) So, I created 'load_raw.xml' based on the previous tutorial, and fit the 'load_raw.py' script. It is sugestedthe script to include some output, for Galaxy to be able to track for completion, that's why a redirection was 

introduced.

<tool id="LoadRaw" name="LoadRaw" version="0.1">
  <description>Loads PubMed-format files obtained from the 

medline database</description>
  <command interpreter="python">
    load_raw.py --citations $citations > $dummyout    
  </command>

  <inputs>
    <param name="citations" type="data" label="Citations"/>
  </inputs>

  <outputs>
    <data format="tabular" name="dummyout" />
  </outputs>

  <help>
    pub_raw.py --citations Citations_file_in_pubmed_format.pubmed
  </help>

</tool>


4) Then I updated the config/tool_conf.xml file as follows:
config/tool_conf.xml
  <section name="LoadRaw" id="mTools">
    <tool file="loadraw/load_raw.xml" />
  </section>

5) Then I created a new folder named 'loadraw' under '/tools' folder, and put the xml and py files inside 'loadraw'.

6) After restarting Galaxy, the new Load Raw tool is shown.
